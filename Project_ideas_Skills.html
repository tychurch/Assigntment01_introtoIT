                SKILLS REQUIRED:<br>
                <br>
            </u>
            In order to create this project Skills will be required with Scripting in c# as well as knowledge on how to operate both
            Blender and Unity3D as well as relevant hardware specifications to run both Blender and Unity3D software.
            <br><br>
            In order to find the Hardware required we need a computer with specifications high enough for our development applications,
            both of the software applications we require for development have free licencing terms and conditions although Unity3D's conditions revolve around profit made off an application(once x amount of money made is reached it is no longer free).
            <br><br>
            In regards to obtaining the relevant skills we can use the unity3D API, presuming known knowledge of some c# is known otherwise we can turn to
            Youtube tutorials for c# as well as various other resources found on the internet however once the basics of c# are understood the Unity3D
            API is all that should be required while working with unity3D other then that knowledge of how to operate the gui of Blender and Unity3d
            is all that is required.
