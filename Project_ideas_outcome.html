                OUTCOME:
                <br>
                <br>
            </u>
            As a result of this project we will have improved upon our development skills as by creating stuff with any scripting language we are
            learning better ways to use the language to our advantage when creating applications, in creating this project we improve on our
            Unity3D,Blender and c# knowledge which includes 3d modeling, graphic design , and scripting(c#).
            <br><br>
            Once the end outcome is reached we will be able to continue with other objects of the project as mentioned above to improve on our game
            as well as having plenty of room to work out bugs such as the way the camera colides with the walls around the player.
            <br><br>
            In later builds databases can be implemented with mySQL if decided a dedicated server to be the better option of presenting this software application.
            the software application model this will require knowledge of mySQL and databases however.
