            The Sofware being used is Unity3d as well as Blender for Models.
<br><br>
            Unity3D will Be used alongside with the "Mirror" asset which is a Networking Module for unity which operates in a similar fashion to
            unity's Previous UNET model which is now depreciated however it has been improved on and uses TCP protocol.
<br><br>
            Unity3D Currently allows for Script Editing using c# or unitys built in scripting language  unityscript (similar to javascript) because unity3D uses such high
            level languages it makes development a much quicker task then alternative Game Engines or using OpenGL/Direct x for application
            Development.
<br><br>
            Blender is a simple 3d model editor with many effects built into the Editor this will primarilly be how we create our models for any
            Destructive Objects as well as creating player models and creatures with physics being implemented and handled by the unity3D engine.
