                <br>
            </u>
            The Game will Start off with a player starting on a building roof for a tutorial this same area will act as a lobby system for single
            and multiplayer.<br><br>
            The same building will be used as an entry point for dungeons.<br><br>
            The ingame Dungeons will be urban themed mostly due. being an office style building for entry.<br><br>
            Upon entering a dungeon you will enter with your co-op players or by yourself if not connected to anyone
            when entering the dungeon.<br><br>

            The host players client will generate the seed for an array which will be generated based on if statements determining
            which part of a map can be generated there from here the host client will send this "seed" or numbers generated to the other clients so all clients generate the map levels the same.
            <br><br>
            Within the dungeon players will be able to find tools which will manipulate physics for example a hook to swing on or
            small explosives to move objects.<br><br>
            
            The player will have a tranquilizer gun by default.<br><br>
            The player will be able to upgrade there Tranquilizer gun Between pistols , Snipers and possible other future concepts.<br><br>
            When a player is using a Tranquilizer gun Some areas may require additional shots to tranquilize enemies.<br><br>
            Creatures within dungeons will be those such as rats which are regular size(keeping in mind youve been shrunk) the same goes for people
            that you run in to which will be regularly sized as well
            once within the building your minimap will reveal areas youve been to and every room will have its own traps or puzzle to overcome
            within dungeons you will be able to find different items which can be broken down into parts and mixed together to created Alcemical potions
            or spells which will be able to manipulate the environment but also be limited to as many as you have crafted.<br><br>
            Once the co-op implementation has been reached this opens the possiblity to create battle royale concepts by inserting multiple teams of players
            into different spawn locations on larger maps with the essential goal of eliminating the target for extraction.<br><br>
            There will be a method of extraction implemented which will likely involve shrinking the target after he/she has been tranquilized.
            <br><br>
            After the initalial project has been implemented, Further ideas can be implemented such as introducing micro cars which can be brought into dungeons or driven around the freeroam
            Area and Customized and possibly combined with other team members vehicles this implementation will open up room for further game modes such as Races
            Another Feature which can be implemented in the Future is to add a "machine" which will enlarge the player to regular size and allow
            for the player to attempt to be an enemy when fighting other players or AI at a later stage.
            <br><br>
            As the player progresses they will earn currency which can be used to purchase additional materials, weapon upgrades, weapons, cars
            and customization options.<br><br>
            Currency will be obtained by claiming bounties associate with the targets Captured or by placing bids on Races and alternative modes
            which will later be implemented.<br><br>
            There will also be Destructible Assests within dungeons.
