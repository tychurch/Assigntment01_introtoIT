            For a long time i have had an interest in IT and have been programming as a hobby for 7-8years now, originally my interest for IT started from playing a game Called Graal online<br>
            which had its own built in programming language from here i started making stuff in the game and finding it fun then eventually i started looking up videos for c++ on youtube
            and started slowly learning it since then i have been using c# with unity and c++ with codeblocks to create applications and games as a hobby.<br> I also dabled with objective c when
            i had a mac to create some ios games which never went passed development versions.<br> since starting to learn to programming from a game ive grown to love programming more and more!
